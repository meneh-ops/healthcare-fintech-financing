    "A healthcare fintech company helps patients finance medical bills and procedures through payment plans offered in partnership with hospitals and clinics.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- A financing application system for patient applications.  \n",
    "- A servicing platform that tracks payment plans and loan status.  \n",
    "- Marketing platforms (paid search/social, provider referrals, affiliates).  \n",
    "- Product analytics tools (e.g., Heap, Amplitude) that track patient behavior across the application funnel.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, each system reports slightly different numbers for \"applications\", \"approvals\", and \"funded plans\", and provider and vendor performance, making it difficult for stakeholders to trust funnel metrics used in provider negotiations and growth planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders need to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How many patients start, submit, and fund a financing application over time, by provider and channel?  \n",
    "- Where are the biggest drop‑offs in the funnel, and how do they vary by provider, service line, vendor, and channel?  \n",
    "- Which partners and marketing channels drive high‑quality, funded payment plans rather than just clicks or incomplete applications?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project defines a shared data model and metric layer for the patient financing funnel, validates data quality across systems, and produces funnel and provider/vendor‑level dashboards that Engineering, Product, Growth, and Provider Partnerships can trust.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Tighten event tracking & schemas:**  \n",
    "  Work with Engineering to ensure all key funnel steps (view, start, submit, approve, fund) are consistently tagged across web and app, and always tied to a stable `application_id` so funnels are reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Establish a shared metrics layer:**  \n",
    "  Promote `fct_applications`, `dim_loan`, and `fct_marketing_attribution` as the single source of truth for funnel and vendor metrics, documented in a central glossary accessible to Product, Ops, and Growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Formalize QA / UAT routines:**  \n",
    "  Automate the validation queries (row counts, referential checks, vendor reconciliation) to run on every data refresh, with alerts if thresholds are breached, so issues are caught before stakeholders see dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standardize vendor & channel dashboards:**  \n",
    "  Create a canonical “Lending Funnel by Vendor & Channel” dashboard and a separate “Data Quality Monitor” dashboard to replace ad‑hoc, one‑off reports and enforce consistent definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Partner with Product on experimentation:**  \n",
    "  Use this metrics layer to define success metrics for UX and policy experiments (e.g., changes to underwriting criteria or application flow) and design dashboards that track experiment outcomes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Roadmap to production‑grade analytics stack:**  \n",
    "  As a follow‑up phase, implement a tool like dbt for modular SQL modeling and testing, and define data contracts with upstream teams so that any schema or tracking changes are coordinated rather than breaking downstream analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This end‑to‑end case study shows how I would approach lending funnel analytics at a fintech like Splash: from raw, inconsistent datasets to a well‑documented, validated metrics layer and actionable dashboards that cross Engineering, Product, and Business stakeholders.\n"
